# Librepass
An opensource password manager
# How to use
* Download the Release.zip and then extract its contents
* Run the librepass.exe file (windows might give a warning, this is due to the program not being signed using a certificate)
# Features
* Nice UI/UX ? :D
* Encrypted password storage
* Easy password access using copy button
* Improved password security by deleting copied password after 10 seconds

# Building 
* Ensure that all necessary flutter setup is done, if flutter is not setup go to [flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
* Open the source code folder and run 
``` 
flutter pub get
```
* Then run
```
flutter build <subcommand>
```
* replace **\<subcommand>** with **-h** if you dont know what to put there, then decide based on the output 
* The files should be built and present in the `build/windows/x64/runner/Release` folder
